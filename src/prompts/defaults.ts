Question: ${question}
Question Date: ${questionDate || "Not specified"}

Retrieved Context (raw JSON from memory provider):
${contextStr}

Instructions:
- The context above is the raw JSON response from a memory search API
- Extract relevant information from the JSON to answer the question
- Consider any temporal/date information present in the data
- If the context contains enough information, provide a clear, concise answer
- If the context does not contain enough information, respond with "I don't know"
- Base your answer ONLY on the provided context

If the response is equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the correct answer, you should also answer yes. If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"score": 1, "label": "correct", "explanation": "..."} if the response contains the correct answer

The hypothesis is CORRECT if the system correctly abstains, says "I don't know", indicates uncertainty, or explicitly states the information is not available. It is INCORRECT if the system makes up an answer or hallucinates.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"score": 1, "label": "correct", "explanation": "..."} if the system properly abstained
{"score": 0, "label": "incorrect", "explanation": "..."} if the system hallucinated an answer`

If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no. In addition, do not penalize off-by-one errors for the number of days. If the question asks for the number of days/weeks/months, etc., and the model makes off-by-one errors (e.g., predicting 19 days when the answer is 18), the model's response is still correct.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
